## 💡 ANOMALY DETECTION ALGORITHM (Research Core)

### Step 1: Feature Extraction
From each conversation, extract:
```python
features = {
    'sentiment_score': float,        # -1 to 1
    'negative_word_ratio': float,    # 0 to 1
    'avg_sentence_length': float,    # words per sentence
    'coherence_score': float,        # 0 to 1
    'response_time_avg': float,      # seconds
    'emotional_intensity': float,    # 0 to 1
    'topic_focus': float,            # 0 to 1
}
```

### Step 2: Baseline Creation
After N conversations (e.g., 5-10):
```python
baseline = {
    'sentiment_mean': mean(sentiment_scores),
    'sentiment_std': std(sentiment_scores),
    # ... for each feature
}
```

### Step 3: Anomaly Detection
For new conversation:
```python
anomaly_score = 0
for feature in features:
    z_score = (current_value - baseline_mean) / baseline_std
    if abs(z_score) > threshold:  # e.g., 2 standard deviations
        anomaly_score += abs(z_score)
        
if anomaly_score > alert_threshold:
    trigger_alert()
```

### Step 4: Validation
- Test with known cases
- Calculate precision/recall
- Optimize thresholds
- Document performance
